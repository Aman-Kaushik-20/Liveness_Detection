# Liveness Detection Project

## 1. Problem Statement
The Liveness Detection Project is designed to distinguish between real human faces and spoofed attacks on biometric systems. The goal is to detect whether the person is real or if various forms of attacks such as printed photos, masks, phone or monitor displays are used to trick the system. The project focuses on detecting the following types of attacks:
- **Outline**: Printed outlines of photos.
- **Outline3d**: Portraits printed on cylindrical surfaces.
- **Mask**: Printed portraits with cut-out eyes.
- **Mask3d**: Connected cardboard masks.
- **Phone**: Photos displayed on a smartphone.
- **Monitor**: Photos displayed on a computer screen.
- **Real**: A real human face.

## 2. Data Collection
The dataset was gathered from multiple sources including real human face captures and spoofed attack images. The dataset covers different lighting conditions, angles, and spoofing methods such as printed masks, phone displays, and monitor attacks. These variations help the model generalize better in detecting real vs fake faces.

## 3. Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved:
- **Face detection**: Using the `cvzone.FaceDetectionModule` to detect faces in the images.
- **Blurriness check**: Images that were too blurry (with a Laplacian variance below a set threshold) were discarded.
- **Bounding box adjustments**: Offsets were added to the detected face areas to ensure complete and accurate face captures.

## 4. Data Labelling
Each image in the dataset was labeled as either:
- **Real**: Representing genuine human faces.
- **Fake**: Representing attacks using masks, photos, or displays.
Bounding box coordinates were calculated for each face in YOLO format, and stored along with the class labels.

## 5. Model Training
The model was trained using the YOLO architecture, which is ideal for real-time object detection tasks. The following steps were followed:
- **Model**: Pretrained YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models were fine-tuned on the liveness dataset.
- **Training process**:
  - Data augmentation techniques were used to improve the model's generalization.
  - The model was trained for 100 epochs with an image size of 640.
  - The training was done on the **COCO** dataset format.

```python
! pip install ultralytics
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load and train the model
model = YOLO("yolo8x.pt")  # Load a pretrained model
results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```

## 6. Model Testing
The trained model was tested in real-time using video input to evaluate its accuracy in detecting spoofed attacks and real faces. The testing was done with a confidence threshold of 0.8.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Define path to directory containing images and videos for inference
source = "path/to/dir"

# Run inference on the source
results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
```

## 7. Results
The model successfully distinguished between real and fake faces across all test cases, including the six types of spoofing attacks. Below are some key observations:


Final Results
Fake Image Testing (Total = 3194):

Predicted Fake: 3105
Predicted Real: 68
No Detections: 21
Real Image Testing (Total = 4641):

Predicted Fake: 3
Predicted Real: 4493
No Detections: 145
These results demonstrate the model's strong performance in detecting fake images, with a high accuracy for both real and spoofed images, although there are some instances of misclassification and no detections.

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved high accuracy in detecting both real and spoofed faces.
- **Real-time performance**: The model ran at a high frame rate  as shown in Video with negligible latency, making it suitable for real-world applications.
